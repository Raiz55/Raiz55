- 👋 Hi, I’m @Raiz55, a no code experience beginner on this journey
- 👀 I’m interested in attaining a career in software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a Full Stack dev from the ground floor with no prior experience
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me understand front end and back end engineering faster and more efficiently 
- 📫 How to reach me? It would best be on Twitter, just search for @0xRaizen. I have Discord and will update more information once my portfolio website is complete
